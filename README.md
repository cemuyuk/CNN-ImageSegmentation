# CNN-ImageSegmentation
Image segmentation on MSRC-v2 dataset

TUM Summer Semester 2022

Image Segmentation via transfer learning by getting AlexNet features and implementing a custom U-net within sequential layers, which you can see in cnn_segmentation.py.

For the demonstrated samples in the Python Notebook, MobileNet50 from TorchVision was used.

p.s. The content is only for demonstration purposes since the data / some utility scripts are not included in the repo. The results of the segmentation can be seen below.
